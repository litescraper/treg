# MoltSets

MoltSets is a pasted Bearer-key enrichment provider at
`https://api.moltsets.com/api/v1/tools`. `oauth_providers.MOLTSETS` verifies a key with free
`POST /get_account`; the account, billing, and usage operations stay internal probes rather than
public tools. MoltSets requires a `User-Agent` on every API request as of 2026-09-16, so
`required_headers` pins `treg/1.0 (+https://treg.to)` for connection probes and every BYOK or
shared-key relay. The capacity collector sends the same value explicitly. This does not rely on
httpx's default client header, and the generic constant-binding path overwrites an empty or stale
caller value without adding provider logic to the relay. A team's own key wins and is never metered
by treg. `platform_key_moltsets` supplies the optional shared credential, and the existing provider
allow-list remains the production switch. This integration does not change that switch.

The catalog exposes 12 of 17 documented data operations: people and company search, name/company
lookups, four profile-to-email variants, phone lookup, two reverse enrichments, three audience/hash
lookups, email-to-profile, and IP-to-company. Every operation was exercised with synthetic inputs.
MoltSets returns HTTP 200 for both hits and misses; `status: ok` is a hit and
`status: not_found` is a free miss. Validation failures and upstream errors are also free. The
catalog-level `expect` rule lets the existing generic `per_success` settlement distinguish these
outcomes without a provider branch.

## Shared-plan boundary

The $27 monthly subscription has no vendor per-call price. The verified paid plan includes 5,000
enrichment records per week, conservatively 20,000 per four-week month. `fx.yaml` therefore declares
a `treg_shared_plan` rate of $0.01 per ordinary successful record: it breaks even at 2,700 calls per
month, or 13.5% utilization of that conservative capacity. This is treg's rate, not a claim that
MoltSets sells individual $0.01 calls. The generic credit conversion, margin, reserve, settle,
release, recovery report, and BYOK precedence remain unchanged.

Nine single-result tools are safe shared-key offers: business email and profile by name, reverse
email and profile lookup, three audience/hash conversions, email-to-profile, and IP-to-company.
They reserve one ordinary record and settle only when `status` is `ok`.

Three exposed tools are BYOK-only:

- People search, company search, and profile search can return variable record counts; profile
  search also has a free `count_only` mode.
The four hybrid profile-to-email operations and hybrid phone lookup are omitted because each accepts
one URL or a batch of up to 100 with mixed hit/miss outcomes. They need a separately designed scalar
or confirmed-batch contract before agents can call them.

## Routing and Arena

Verified adapters add four existing contract candidates: `people.email.find` by name/domain and
`people.enrich` by name/domain, email, or professional-profile URL. They map canonical identity
fields to the documented JSON bodies and map the MoltSets envelope back to the existing contract.
Direct responses are still relayed unchanged. No new routed contract or Arena branch exists;
ordinary adapter discovery supplies the candidates. Provider-specific audience and IP capabilities
stay direct tools because no compatible shared contract exists.

## Capacity and evidence

`collectors._moltsets` calls free `POST /get_account`, validates the standard envelope, and reports
the tighter of the rolling five-hour and weekly enrichment-record remainders. Its note includes
enrichment/search record and request headroom. If those enrichment meters are absent or invalid,
capacity is unknown; a token or phone balance is a different meter and is never relabelled as
enrichment capacity.

The default policy is `rolling_quota / subscription / api`; `rolling_quota` names a quota whose
remaining amount is reported across rolling windows rather than resetting on a calendar boundary.
The paid plan's 5,000 enrichment requests per five hours is capacity, not a burst-rate instruction:
encoding it in the spacer would add 3.6 seconds before every routed attempt. `_RATE_LIMITS` instead
sets an explicit routing-friendly shared-key pace of 10 requests/second. Search has a lower allowance
but all search tools are BYOK-only. No auto-top-up, overflow route, or exhaustion signature is
claimed.

Live checks covered invalid auth, free account probes, validation errors, hits, misses, pagination,
batch mixtures, both plan states, all data paths, and the phone dual meter. They used 49 API requests
and two phone-token hits, within the task's hard cap. The paid plan showed enrichment limits of
1,000 records per five hours and 5,000 per week, search limits of 500 and 2,500 respectively, and
request limits five times the five-hour record pools. Ordinary hits moved the matching record pool;
misses, account calls, and errors did not. A phone hit moved both the enrichment-record pool and the
phone-token balance. Stored examples contain only reserved synthetic identities or empty results.
